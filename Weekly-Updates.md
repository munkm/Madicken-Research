### Update: 2014/10/01

**Lit Review Work:**
* Read through AVATAR paper, took notes (I'll add a link to this later)
* Started reading ORNL report.

**Git Repo:**
* For the moment, I've made my own git repo under a really generic title. I think this way after I move beyond the lit review, this can still be the place that I put weekly updates and whatnot. I have a few thoughts:
  *For my lit review notes, should I put them in your AngularHybridLitReview folder? 
  * If not, I could:
    * Make a subfolder in this directory that has its own markdown file for each paper, then link each paper to a top 'lit review' page
    * Put all of my notes in a lit review page. 
 
**Other Work:**
* Skype meeting with Leah went well. We have a major start on the geology-specific paper. I should be starting my outline for the neutronics paper this weekend. 

**Goals for next week:**
* Finish ORNL report. 
* Skim associated papers that I downloaded that were referenced in Larsen & Cooper and FW CADIS papers
* Respond to prof. Greenspan's comments on my master's report. 
* Outline neutronics-specific paper for rover project
