### Update: 2014/10/29
**Goals from last week:**
* **Started** Continue on reviewing math methods
* **Started** Get stuff written up in LaTeX

**Other things:**
* When I get rover paper written up, where/how should I submit it
  * Is it better to submit papers to conferences? How do I balance publications in peer-revieiwed journals with conferences? 
  * Feeling a little lost in where I'm going right now
* Tried to do a big push this week to get some rover stuff out of the way.
  * Outlined neutronics paper for rover project
    * Focus of this paper is the reasons we made design-specific decisions neutronically
  * Sent all data to my colleagues.  

**Goals for next week:**
* Make poster for ANS
* Actually get LaTeX writeups on github page
* Start doing some C++ tutorials
* Go back to reading papers
* Finish giant HW assignment for my class.

**Other things:**
* I started reviewing some linear algebra and methods stuff. 
* I have a midterm this week, so I've mostly been focusing on that.

* I have been going back through the math theory stuff we talked about last week. Thank you for providing these.  

**Goals for Next Week**
* Personally, I would like to focus on some of the math background. What are your thoughts on this? 
* Paper suggestions? 

### Update: 2014/10/08

**Goals from last week:**
* **No** Finish ORNL report. (Done reading, but still going back and taking notes.)
* **Done** Skim associated papers that I downloaded that were referenced in Larsen & Cooper and FW CADIS papers
* **Done** Respond to prof. Greenspan's comments on my master's report.
* **Started** Outline neutronics-specific paper for rover project

**Lit Review Work:**
* I'm still working on the .tex document outlines for each paper I've read. 

**Goals for Next Week:**
* Finish ORNL report.

### Update: 2014/10/01

**Lit Review Work:**
* Read through AVATAR paper, took notes (I'll add a link to this later)
* Started reading ORNL report.

**Git Repo:**
* For the moment, I've made my own git repo under a really generic title. I think this way after I move beyond the lit review, this can still be the place that I put weekly updates and whatnot. I have a few thoughts:
  *For my lit review notes, should I put them in your AngularHybridLitReview folder? 
  * If not, I could:
    * Make a subfolder in this directory that has its own markdown file for each paper, then link each paper to a top 'lit review' page
    * Put all of my notes in a lit review page. 
 
**Other Work:**
* Skype meeting with Leah went well. We have a major start on the geology-specific paper. I should be starting my outline for the neutronics paper this weekend. 

**Goals for next week:**
* Finish ORNL report. 
* Skim associated papers that I downloaded that were referenced in Larsen & Cooper and FW CADIS papers
* Respond to prof. Greenspan's comments on my master's report. 
* Outline neutronics-specific paper for rover project
