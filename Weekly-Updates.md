### Update: 2014/12/10
**Goals from last week:**
* **Done** I have a paper for my policy class due and a homework due for the same class.
  * I plan on focusing on these for the rest of the week.
* **Done** I will upload more papers on the weekend (and get a current bibtex file).
* **Done** After the weekend I'd like to read at least two more papers. 
* **In Progress** Get a good draft of the mars rover work sent out by the end of next week (~12/12).

**Upcoming week:**
* Continue uploading notes from papers
* Read three more papers for lit review
* Study for final
* Work on draft/revisions of mars rover paper

### Update: 2014/12/03
**Goals from Last week:**
* **done, but not as much as I'd like** Continue with mars rover neutronics report
* **Not done** Read a few more papers for the lit review. 
* **Done** Continue reading Importance: The Adjoint
* **Done** Add .tex files to github repo and make PDFs linkable from my research page
  * I've only uploaded a few so far, but I am happy with the linking and how things turned out. More will be merged later this week. 
  * My plan is to have a full document compiling all the notes with a proper bibtex document added too. Does this seem like a good plan? 

**Upcoming week:**
* I have a paper for my policy class due and a homework due for the same class. 
  * I plan on focusing on these for the rest of the week.

* Get a good draft of the mars rover work sent out by the end of next week (~12/12).

**Other things:**
* Should I go to that NSSC open source tools thing? I am not sure it is super relevant to my research area. 

### Update: 2014/11/24
**Updates from last week:**
* The group meeting went really well. Professor Greenspan had a lot to say about what we've done so far, and was very happy to provide some resources based on past work that he has done. 
  * I'm actually including several of these in the background and 'future work' sections of the paper that we're writing.
  * Paper is being written in LaTeX. woo! (my original outline was not) 
  * I plan on getting you a draft of the neutronics-specific report that we're sending to ESA in the next two weeks. Are you okay being on the report **and** the paper (both neutronics-specific)? 
* Talked to Leah on the Mars Rover work for the firt time in a few weeks. We now have all of our data completed, so it's just writing at this point.
  * After ANS I ran a few different fissionable materials, like we talked about, and have results on the criticality as a funciton of mass for several materials.
* Went back to the hybrid methods lit review. Got to read two papers this week. 

**Upcoming week**
* Continue with mars rover neutronics report
* Read a few more papers for the lit review. 
* Continue reading Importance: The Adjoint

### Update: 2014/10/29
**Goals from last week:**
* **Started** Continue on reviewing math methods
* **Started** Get stuff written up in LaTeX

**Other things:**
* When I get rover paper written up, where/how should I submit it
  * Is it better to submit papers to conferences? How do I balance publications in peer-revieiwed journals with conferences? 
  * Feeling a little lost in where I'm going right now
* Tried to do a big push this week to get some rover stuff out of the way.
  * Outlined neutronics paper for rover project
    * Focus of this paper is the reasons we made design-specific decisions neutronically
  * Sent all data to my colleagues.  

**Goals for next week:**
* Make poster for ANS
* Actually get LaTeX writeups on github page
* Start doing some C++ tutorials
* Go back to reading papers
* Finish giant HW assignment for my class. 

### Update: 2014/10/22
**Goals from last week:**
* **Done** Starting on math backrgound
* **Not Done** Papers (although we never really decided this was a goal anyways)

**Other things:**
* I started reviewing some linear algebra and methods stuff. 
* I have a midterm this week, so I've mostly been focusing on that. 
* Should I start thinking of conferences to go to? 

**Goals for next week:**
* Continue on reviewing math methods
* Get stuff written up in LaTeX


### Update: 2014/10/15

**Goals from last week:**

* **Done** Read 2 more papers from shared dropbox folder. What are your thoughts on these three (?):
  * **Read** Gol'din
  * **Read** Miften and Larsen
    * Supplemented these with summary section II.G from M.L. Adams and E.W. Larsen book you provided
  * **Not Read** E.T. Jaynes (if I can get to it!) 

**Lit Review Work:**
* Acquired Hendricks (1982) **Read**
* Acquired Booth (1982) **Read**

**Other Things:**

* Room paid for by Prof. Vujic, Air travel paid by ANS
* I have been going back through the math theory stuff we talked about last week. Thank you for providing these.  

**Goals for Next Week**
* Personally, I would like to focus on some of the math background. What are your thoughts on this? 
* Paper suggestions? 

### Update: 2014/10/08

**Goals from last week:**
* **No** Finish ORNL report. (Done reading, but still going back and taking notes.)
* **Done** Skim associated papers that I downloaded that were referenced in Larsen & Cooper and FW CADIS papers
* **Done** Respond to prof. Greenspan's comments on my master's report.
* **Started** Outline neutronics-specific paper for rover project

**Lit Review Work:**
* I'm still working on the .tex document outlines for each paper I've read. 

**Goals for Next Week:**
* Finish ORNL report. 
* Read 2 more papers from shared dropbox folder. What are your thoughts on these three (?):
  * Gol'din
  * Miften and Larsen

### Update: 2014/10/01

**Lit Review Work:**
* Read through AVATAR paper, took notes (I'll add a link to this later)
* Started reading ORNL report.

**Git Repo:**
* For the moment, I've made my own git repo under a really generic title. I think this way after I move beyond the lit review, this can still be the place that I put weekly updates and whatnot. I have a few thoughts:
  *For my lit review notes, should I put them in your AngularHybridLitReview folder? 
  * If not, I could:
    * Make a subfolder in this directory that has its own markdown file for each paper, then link each paper to a top 'lit review' page
    * Put all of my notes in a lit review page. 
 
**Other Work:**
* Skype meeting with Leah went well. We have a major start on the geology-specific paper. I should be starting my outline for the neutronics paper this weekend. 

**Goals for next week:**
* Finish ORNL report. 
* Skim associated papers that I downloaded that were referenced in Larsen & Cooper and FW CADIS papers
* Respond to prof. Greenspan's comments on my master's report. 
* Outline neutronics-specific paper for rover project
