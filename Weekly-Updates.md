**Goals for next time:**

I'd like to go a little lighter on my workload this upcoming stretch, because my parents' house is filled with people and I'm going to have very little privacy to work and/or focus. I'd also like to take a few full days off. Until our next update I'll do the following:  
* Try to get good draft of mars rover paper finished by M&C deadline. I'm now uncomfortably behind on this, and I need to put it first. 
* Read one more paper for lit review
* Get master document of lit review to compile correctly

### Update: 2014/12/10

* **Done** Continue reading Importance: The Adjoint
* **Done** Add .tex files to github repo and make PDFs linkable from my research page
  * I've only uploaded a few so far, but I am happy with the linking and how things turned out. More will be merged later this week. 
  * My plan is to have a full document compiling all the notes with a proper bibtex document added too. Does this seem like a good plan? 

**Upcoming week:**
* I have a paper for my policy class due and a homework due for the same class. 
  * I plan on focusing on these for the rest of the week.

**Other things:**
* Should I go to that NSSC open source tools thing? I am not sure it is super relevant to my research area. 

### Update: 2014/11/24
**Updates from last week:**
* The group meeting went really well. Professor Greenspan had a lot to say about what we've done so far, and was very happy to provide some resources based on past work that he has done. 
  * I'm actually including several of these in the background and 'future work' sections of the paper that we're writing.
  * Paper is being written in LaTeX. woo! (my original outline was not) 
  * I plan on getting you a draft of the neutronics-specific report that we're sending to ESA in the next two weeks. Are you okay being on the report **and** the paper (both neutronics-specific)? 
* Talked to Leah on the Mars Rover work for the firt time in a few weeks. We now have all of our data completed, so it's just writing at this point.
  * After ANS I ran a few different fissionable materials, like we talked about, and have results on the criticality as a funciton of mass for several materials.
* Went back to the hybrid methods lit review. Got to read two papers this week.

* **Started** Continue on reviewing math methods
* **Started** Get stuff written up in LaTeX

**Other things:**

* **No** Finish ORNL report. (Done reading, but still going back and taking notes.)
* **Done** Skim associated papers that I downloaded that were referenced in Larsen & Cooper and FW CADIS papers
* **Done** Respond to prof. Greenspan's comments on my master's report.
* **Started** Outline neutronics-specific paper for rover project

**Lit Review Work:**
* I'm still working on the .tex document outlines for each paper I've read. 

**Goals for Next Week:**

### Update: 2014/10/01

**Lit Review Work:**
* Read through AVATAR paper, took notes (I'll add a link to this later)
* Started reading ORNL report.

**Git Repo:**
* For the moment, I've made my own git repo under a really generic title. I think this way after I move beyond the lit review, this can still be the place that I put weekly updates and whatnot. I have a few thoughts:
  *For my lit review notes, should I put them in your AngularHybridLitReview folder? 
  * If not, I could:
    * Make a subfolder in this directory that has its own markdown file for each paper, then link each paper to a top 'lit review' page
    * Put all of my notes in a lit review page. 
 
**Other Work:**
* Skype meeting with Leah went well. We have a major start on the geology-specific paper. I should be starting my outline for the neutronics paper this weekend. 

**Goals for next week:**
* Finish ORNL report. 
* Skim associated papers that I downloaded that were referenced in Larsen & Cooper and FW CADIS papers
* Respond to prof. Greenspan's comments on my master's report. 
* Outline neutronics-specific paper for rover project
