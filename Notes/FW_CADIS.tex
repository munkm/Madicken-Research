\section{Forward-Weighted CADIS Method for Global Variance Reduction}
\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{outline}
 \1 CADIS = Consisted Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling
 \1 Adjoint function can be used as a measure of importance of a particle to some objective function. 
   \2 Very effective for localized quantities
   \2 Not good for global distributions. 
 \1 Many methods use deterministic adjoint functions for MC VR. 
   \2 CADIS method
 \1 Global Solutions
   \2 Cannot use adjoint function
   \2 Cooper and Larsen used inverted Forward Flux as importance function
     \3 Had some benefit. 
     \3 Evenly distributes particles throughout system, does not represent the expected contribution throughout the system. 
       \4 When applied to a large realistic application, is not effective
\end{outline}
\subsection{Theory}
\begin{outline}
  \1 FW-Cadis method
    \2 Forward information used to define response to be used in deterministic adjoint calculation
      \3 Then generate adjoint importance function for achieving uniform particle density throughout the system. 
    \2 Possible to optimize for global quantities
      \3 Flux, dose rate distribtuion
    \2 Also possible to optimize for semi-global responses depending on how adding is defined. 
       \3 Multiple localized detectors/spectra
