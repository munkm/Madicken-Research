\section{A code-generated Monte Carlo Importance Function}
\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{outline}
 \1 Describes method that automatically chooses importance function for MC
   \2 simple
   \2 easily implemented
   \2 eliminates need for intuition 
 \1 WW generated by tracking particle weights entering and leaving a region
\end{outline}
\subsection{Automatic Weight Window Generation}
\begin{outline}
 \1 WW generation is at least as effective as importance sampling 
 \1 Choosing Whigh and Wlow for weight window is difficult
   \2 Booth describes a method where a problem with a specified importance function and produces the optimum weight window that can be used
   \2 This method defines 
     \3 Wlow = 1/(k*N) (sumWin+sumWout)
     \3 Whigh = k*Wlow 
     \3 k = constant
     \3 N = number of particles 
\end{outline}
\subsection{Results}
\begin{outline}
 \1 Code generated WWs are as good as importance sampling by experienced MC user
 \1 Energy-dependent WW >> best geometrical importance sampling
 \1 Generated WWs give insight as to the energy and geometry of the particles in each region
 \1 This is very compatible with other VR techniques
 \1 Disadvantage:
   \2 All regions of phase space are populated equally
   \2 can be controlled by using other VR techniques
\end{outline}
