### Meeting: 2015/06/17
Things to bring up:
* What did tom say about scheduling for my quals?
* Need to remember to push my quals study schedule to here. In general, I'm doing the following:
  * By Month:
    * June: Transport & methods background
    * July: Lit review writeup and review
    * August: Policy, transport, methods, and reactor physics review
    * September: Review everything
  * By Week:
    * M,W,F mornings: Angular Hybrid Methods project
    * M,W,F afternoons: Study
    * T,R mornings: Study
    * T,R afternoons: Variable (whichever I prefer)
* Next friday, 6/26, call with ORNL including Rachel. 


### Meeting: 2014/10/15
Main Notes: 
ANS meeting:
* Math & Comp Program Sunday 1-2, 2-4 exec. 
* Reactor Physics Program Sunday 2-4, 4-6 exec.
* Need committee meeting (After presidents reception)
  * Gives financial need based scholarships
  * Programs that help try to promote diversity in nuclear engineering. 
* Young members group Monday 11:30-1.

Other things:
* In terms of background stuff, start with rachel's thesis background, and then go to exhinilation methods. 
* Read one of the Larsen papers printed in binder. 

### Meeting: 2014/10/01
Main Notes:
* Plan for next week seems appropriate. 
* Lit review notes will be in LaTex
* Future meetings will be at 2:30 for now, since right after the neutronics group meeting left both parties a bit hangry. 
* Of interest: there are two main 'camps' that address finding global solutions in MC. The LIFT method takes the zero variance approach, but other methods try to evenly distribute the particles. 
  * FW CADIS is sort of a hybrid of both methods. 

Other Suggestions:
* change home.md to readme.md so it is automatically rendered.
* on readme.md add a link to personal Zotero page
* GHPages branch will automatically render pages, but it needs to be uploaded as a .pdf. If you want rendered versions of things, you can put the pdfs in this branch and they will be available on your github webpage. 
  * maybe this can be a good way to test out makefiles, since I can have the .pdfs update every time i update the .tex documents.  


### Meeting: 2014/09/24
* Eventually thesis readings will be necessary. A few relevant theses:
  * John Wagner's thesis -- CADIS
  * Scott Turner's thesis -- LIFT method


### Meeting: 2014/09/10
* Aim for review paper by the end of the semester
* First four papers to read:
  * Cooper and Larsen
  * CADIS and FW CADIS
  * Avatar
  * ORNL TM rev 12, Consistent Adjoint-driven
